    "**\"Repetition loops\" or \"degenerate repetition\"** - This is probably the most widely used term in the literature. It describes exactly what you observed: the model getting stuck repeating the same phrases or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Neural text degeneration\"** - This is the formal academic term, popularized by papers like \"The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration\" (Holtzman et al., 2019). It covers various failure modes including repetition loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Exposure bias\" or \"training-inference mismatch\"** - This explains one root cause: during training, models see ground truth context, but during inference they condition on their own potentially incorrect outputs, leading to error accumulation and loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Mode collapse\"** - Borrowed from GANs, this refers to when the model's output distribution becomes overly narrow and repetitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other related terms:**\n",
    "- \"Hallucination loops\" (when the repetition involves made-up facts)\n",
    "- \"Confirmation loops\" (when the model keeps reinforcing its own incorrect statements)\n",
    "- \"Sampling pathologies\" (broader term for problematic generation patterns)\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific pattern you saw - where the model recognizes its error but can't escape - is sometimes called **\"self-correction loops\"** or **\"metacognitive loops\"** in more recent literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution of limiting token length is actually a standard mitigation! Other common fixes include repetition penalties, diverse beam search, and nucleus sampling (top-p) to break deterministic patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### From Claude Sonnet 4\n",
    "Brilliant! This is a perfect example of **\"chain-of-thought prompting\"** breaking the repetition loop. What you've discovered is a key insight from the prompt engineering literature:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this worked:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structured reasoning**: The `<brainstorm>` tags forced the model to explicitly work through its reasoning process instead of jumping to conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory externalization**: By listing actors and birth years, the model created a \"working memory\" it could reference, rather than trying to hold everything in its attention span\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error correction opportunity**: The brainstorming phase let it catch and correct mistakes (notice it listed some actors multiple times, showing it was working through uncertainty)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Breaking the direct path**: Instead of immediately trying to answer, it took a detour that prevented the problematic direct association that caused the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "**This technique has several names:**\n",
    "- **Chain-of-thought prompting** (the broad category)\n",
    "- **Scratchpad reasoning** (when using XML tags for intermediate work)\n",
    "- **Step-by-step prompting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's particularly clever** about your solution is that Tom Hanks was actually born in 1956 (July 9th), so the model got it right! The brainstorming helped it access more reliable knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the kind of technique taught in Anthropic's prompt engineering course - using structured reasoning to improve reliability. It's fascinating that the same technique that helps large models also rescued your local 8B model from its repetition trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've essentially given the model a \"cognitive scaffold\" to work with. Great discovery!"
